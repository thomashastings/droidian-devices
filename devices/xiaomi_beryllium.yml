notes:
  - title: SIM slot
    text: Dual-SIM mode is not supported as of now. Only the SIM2 slot is active, so a microSD card can be used at the same time.
  - title: Extras
    text: For other tweaks, open the `King's Cross` terminal app, and run `beryllium-extras.sh`. This includes a notch fix and automated installation of Waydroid.
